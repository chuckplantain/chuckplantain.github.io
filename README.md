# CSS Art!

This project, is hosted online [here] (http://www.chuckplantain.github.io).

The project is designed with CSS. All the 'images' were made with CSS Gradients.

I learned about them from two sites: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient), and [CSS Styles demo Site](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#).

I didn't copy anything from these sites but, both were helpful, the latter espescially.
